# PixelPerfect
FFXIV Dalamud Plugin for showing hitbox

This fork of Haplo64's Pixel Perfect is designed to add some additional functionality to the plugin. 

Included functionality includes:
- Allowance for 2 custom rings to be set by the player
- Default 'class rings' that show the radius of various abilities
- An extension to those class rings that allows you to see the radius of pet abilities.

While the Custom Rings appear to work as intended, There is some checking to be done on the 'class rings' to make sure their radii are accurate, ditto to the Pet rings.

Currently I'm working on the ability to add 'class rings', which would give you the option to show 'buffs' that you allies can cast. This is *very* rough.
